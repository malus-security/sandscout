% Queries
%

% query1 seems to be working very well. It finds 10 violations for iOS 9.0.2 container
query1 :-
  allow(file-writeSTAR, A),
  getConFilters(B), intersection(A,B,[]),   %ignores objectLists that contain files in the container directories
  getallCaps(C), intersection(A,C,M), %get capabilities in list and put them in M
  getTPCapabilities(T), intersection(M,T,M),  %if all of M is also in T, then there were no sys caps.
  open('outputFromQueries/query1.out',append,Stream),
    write(Stream,A),  nl(Stream),
    close(Stream),
  fail.


% query2 seems to work too, but there are some photo files that it suggests are readable, and I know they are not.
% This seems to be because of some conflicting rules in container... Maybe there is a problem with SandBlaster's output.
query2 :-
  allow(O, A),
  getreadOps(R), member(O, R), %limits O to read operations
  getConFilters(B), intersection(A,B,[]),  %ignores objectLists that contain files in the container directories
  getallCaps(C), intersection(A,C,[]), %ignores objectLists that contain capabilities
  open('outputFromQueries/query2.out',append,Stream),
    write(Stream,O), write(Stream,","), write(Stream,A),  nl(Stream),
    close(Stream),
  fail.


% This query should consider literals that overlap with subpaths or regular expressions.
query3:-
  allow(R1, L1), allow(W1, L2), %we are trying to match two different allow operations
  getreadOps(R2), member(R1,R2), %first allow is a read operation
  getWriteOps(W2), member(W1,W2), %second allow is a write operation
  getConFilters(B), intersection(L1,B,[]), %we don't care about files in container directories
  getConFilters(B), intersection(L2,B,[]), %we don't care about files in container directories
  getallCaps(C), intersection(L1,C,[]), %we don't care about files that require capabilities
  getallCaps(C), intersection(L2,C,[]), %we don't care about files that require capabilities
  getallFiles(FL), member(F1,FL), member(F2,FL), %we only care about overlapping files
  member(F1,L1), member(F2,L2), %are the Fs in the object lists of both allows?
  overlap(F1,F2),
  open('outputFromQueries/query3.out',append,Stream),
    write(Stream,R1), write(Stream,","),
    write(Stream,L1), write(Stream,","),
    write(Stream,W1), write(Stream,","),
    write(Stream,L2),  nl(Stream),
    close(Stream),
  fail.


% Query 4 is similar to query 2, but it only shows subpaths and literals that are in /private/var/mobile
query4 :-
  allow(O, A),
  getreadOps(R), member(O, R), %limits O to read operations
  getConFilters(B), intersection(A,B,[]),  %ignores objectLists that contain files in the container directories
  getallCaps(C), intersection(A,C,[]), %ignores objectLists that contain capabilities
  %If i take this code out we get more results
  %%%%%%%%%%%%begin experimental code
    ((getallFiles(FL), member(F,FL), %F is a file
    member(F,A), %F is in the list for the current fact

    (getallFiles(FL2),
